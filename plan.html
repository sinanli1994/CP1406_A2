<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong>  
<ul>
<li>from our team , each member co-ordinate's very well. </li>
<li>every decision related to the project is made by the permission of every single team</li>
<li>we divide our work with self responsibilities and also complete it in given time.</li>
<li>in our team, mistake made by one person always got corrected by the other team members or with the help of other team members.
</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> <ul>
<li>since all the team members have different schedules, we dont have enough time to sit together and discuss about the projects and teamwork. </li>
<li>still need to fix a lot of things in our project(too many types of fonts, need to fix the search bar</li></ul> 

</p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> <ul>
<li>our team leader is so cool, he does not push us towards goal, but he also make us feel relax so we can do our jobs with calm minds. </li>
<li>in our team, may be sometimes we dont look that much serious towards work or project, but after having some fun we always shift our focus towards our goals.</li></ul></p>
